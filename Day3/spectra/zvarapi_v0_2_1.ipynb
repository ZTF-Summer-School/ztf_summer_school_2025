        "### **API Changelog (v0.2.1, 2025/05/15):**\n",
        "- **PanSTARRs IDs are now returned as strings and not BigInt/Int64, since this isn't compatible with some python packages and javascript library. This way, ZVAR IDs are also Strings just like all other external catalogs we query against. However, the API can still take these IDs as Integers, to avoid any breaking changes**\n",

        "### **API Changelog (v0.2.0):**\n",
        "- **HTTP methods sending a JSON body are now all of type POST (and not GET), to comply with the HTTP standards.**\n",
        "- **You can now look for ZVAR sources that match with sources from other catalogs (based on the other catalogs' IDs).**\n",
        "- **You can now retrieve the image difference forced photometry lightcurves in flux-space.**\n",
        "- **Full Rest API documentation available [here](http://hypernova.caltech.edu:5000/docs)**\n",

        "- **The `Client` Python class has been updated to support the new endpoint, the GET - > POST method changes, and the photometry format option. This is the only cell that has been edited from the first notebook, everything else is identical.**\n",
        "- **A new section demoing the `external_xmatch` (to find ZVAR sources starting from the IDs of sources in other catalogs) has been ad**\n",
        "- **A new section has been added at the very end of the notebook that shows the photometry format in action, add gives you some tips on how to convert the data returned by the API to dataframes and vice versa.**\n",

        "In this notebook, I compiled a number of examples of how to use the ZVAR API's current version. For context, the ZVAR API is a RESTful (HTTP) API that allows users to interact with the ZVAR data products progammatically, exposing data in a structured manner without requiring anyone to download large files. The API is designed to be easy to use, and as simple as possible. The main goal is to provide access to objects in ZVAR via ID-based or position-based queries, to download their lightcurves, and to cross-match them with other catalogs.\n",
        "The API is currently in its early stages, and we are working on adding more features and improving the documentation. We welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Notes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **The API requires authentication, reach out to `tdulaz@caltech.edu` for access.**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **This has been designed to showcase the API specifically, the existing `zvartools` python package is currently being edited to make use of this API rather than require you to download large files. An update will be sent once these are updated.**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **All the plots and methods shown here will be found in the package, most variables that are regular dictionaries here will be replaced by Python classes, for convenience. Except if you think that dictionaries are best, just let me know!**\n",

Python just isn't built for interactivity, and the plot designed here should only be used with a limited number of objects as Jupyter Notebooks have a tendency to be pretty memory inefficient especially with interactive plots (which aren't just static images, but contain all the data they need to display).\n",

        "This plot comes with a number of features:\n",
        "- It allows you to select you the period to plot, from the multiple potential periods that are returned by the API for an object.\n",
        "- It allows you to apply binning to your data (set to 0 to deactivate).\n",
        "- It allows you to quickly multiple the period used by 2 or 3, and to divide it by 2 or 3.\n",
        "- You can choose to display the phase one or twice.\n",
        "- You can easily reset your multipliers and go back to the original period with the Reset button.\n",
        "- 2 buttons allow you to copy the PSID+period to the clipboard, or to get a link for that object on SIMBAD (doesn't work in `vscode`, only in `jupyter` via your browser).\n",
